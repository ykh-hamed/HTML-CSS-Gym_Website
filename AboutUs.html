<h1>About Us</h1>
<h2>Why choose Adrenaline Gym?</h2>
<p>We do things differently here. We are genuinely interested in you and your fitness goals. So if you are looking to gain muscle tone, lose weight, increase muscle size and definition, gain energy, maximise your stamina and endurance or just gain a good level of fitness and feel happier and healthier, then Adrenaline is the right Gym for you!</p>
 
<h2>Our Staff</h2>
<p>One thing that often irritates gym users is unfriendly and unhelpful gym staff! Sadly too many people have experienced this, but now it’s a thing of the past. Here at Adrenaline, our staff members are not just highly qualified and knowledgeable, but also friendly, approachable and fun! They all have a keen personal interest in keeping fit or playing sports so can relate to you and your needs.</p>
 
<h2>Gym Induction</h2>
<p>Never used a gym before? Nervous or unsure about what to do? Don’t Worry! Once you become a member we don’t just give you a membership card and tell you to figure it out on your own. A member of staff will fully induct you into the gym. This means they will walk you through the gym floor explaining all the machines and equipment, how to use them correctly, what they do, and how to maintain technique in repetitions.</p>
 
<h2>Personal Fitness Assessments</h2>
<p>We apologise in advance, but we are going to test you! We all need a starting point and it is important to know what your beginning level of fitness is. For a small fee, we give our members rigorous one-to-one personal fitness assessments which begin on joining, with re-assessments every 6-8 weeks if desired. We sit down and discuss the results with you, talk about your own personal goals and then create a personalised training program, designed to achieve your goals. The re-assessments help to track your progress and allow us to change and upgrade your training program as you get fitter and see the results you want!</p>
 
<h2>FREE Fitness Classes</h2>
<p>Says exactly what it means! Our standard fitness classes are FREE to members. We offer a wide variety of classes throughout each day including, Body Sculpt, Boxercise, Total Tone, Spinning, Circuit Training and Boot Camp. Classes give you an extra option and help you add variety to your training program – and they can be fun too!</p>
<h2>OUR BELIEFS</h2>
<p>We’re here to help you achieve a healthy balance. We think everybody deserves the right to live a healthier lifestyle without paying a premium or being tied into a contract.
Traditionally, gyms have charged a high monthly fee, and made you sign a year’s contract for the privilege. Combined with restrictive opening hours this puts most gyms out of the reach of ordinary people: shift workers, students and those looking for an affordable Gym.
We’ve changed all that.The Gym is open 24/7, almost every day of the year. We don’t make our members sign a contract, because frankly we think it’s unfair and there’s no need; after all, if you provide a great experience and top quality equipment, people will keep coming back. We also keep a close eye on the newest fitness trends and developments.
We’re not only committed to improving the health of the great British public either. We want to do our bit to make the world greener. That’s why we try to run The Gym as sustainably as possible, according to our Green Policy.</p>
